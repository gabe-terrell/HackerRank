# Project Euler

This repository is a collection of problems I have solved on Project Euler via
HackerRank. HackerRank sets up the problem such that you solve the original
Project Euler problem plus a series of additional cases similar to the problem.
In this way, there are more checks to make sure one's code is truly correct in
relation to the problem.

Each folder contains three files:
* problem_statement.pdf -- HackerRank's description of the problem
* euler.txt -- The input you can put into the program to get the answer for the
original Project Euler problem
* *.py / *.cpp -- My solution to the problem
